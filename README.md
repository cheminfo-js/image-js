Image processing and manipulation in JavaScript

## [API Documentation](https://image-js.github.io/core/)

## Installation

`npm install image-js`

## Development

### JavaScript tips and tricks

https://github.com/image-js/core/wiki/JavaScript-tips-and-tricks

### Setup

* You will have first to install Node.js. We recommend to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install and keep node up to date
* For the development we are using https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
* In order to be able to connect to GitHub easily it is interesting to add your public SSH key in the preferences of your GitHub account. Detailed procedure is available at https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/.
* After, you may clone and install the project from a console:

```
mkdir image-js
cd image-js
git clone git@github.com:image-js/core.git
cd core
npm install
```

Notes:
* npm install may require the compilation of some code.
  It is therefore necessary to have the compiler.
  On OSX you will have to install the command line tools
  Run `xcode-select --install` and click on "install"
* in order to test you need to install the npm 'canvas'. Follow the instructions for your OS [here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#installation)
